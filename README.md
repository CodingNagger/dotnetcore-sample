# dotnetcore-sample

Sample project allowing to get started with .NET Core. Was generated using the .NET Core CLI tools to illustrate a blog post written by Jean-Dominique Nguele and [available on blog.iamnguele.com](https://blog.iamnguele.com/2018/01/25/dot-net-core-cli-tools-10-minutes-api/). The commands below show how to quickly get started and must be ran from the root folder.

## Run the API

```
dotnet run --project DotNetCoreSampleApi
```

## Test the API

```
dotnet test DotNetCoreSampleApi.Tests
```
